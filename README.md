# Predictive-Maintenace-Case_Study
Failure prediction is a major topic in predictive maintenance in many industries. Observing machine health and condition through sensor data is assumed to facilitate this type of maintenance by predicting Time-To-Failure (TTF) or Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of in-service equipment. This project aim to explore in this area.

By exploring the sensor values over time, the machine learning algorithm can learn the relationship between the sensor values and changes in sensor values to the historical failures in order to predict failures in the future.

- Regression Modeling algorithms were used to predict the number remaining cycles before failure.
- Binary Classification algorithms were used to predict if the engine will fail within specific cycles window or not.
- Multiclass classification algorithms were used predict in which cycles window or period will an engine will fail.
