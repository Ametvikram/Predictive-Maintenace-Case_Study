# Predictive-Maintenace-Case_Study
Failure prediction is a major topic in predictive maintenance in many industries. Observing machine health and condition through sensor data is assumed to facilitate this type of maintenance by predicting Time-To-Failure (TTF) or Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of in-service equipment. This project aim to explore in this area
